## React Notes App

This is my first ever react app! The foundation of this app derives from Facebooks's Create react app. 

### Getting up and running with this app
Please ensure NodeJS is installed; any version above version 6 should be fine.

### Use npm or yarn to run the app
```
npm start or yarn start
```
### Viewing the app in the browser
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
